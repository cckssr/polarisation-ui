"""
Robust launcher for the application. When executed as a script from the
repository root or from an installed package folder the module `src.main`
should be executed as a module so that its intra-package relative imports work
correctly. On Windows executing a script inside a package folder often fails
with "attempted relative import with no known parent" if the module is simply
imported; to avoid this we prefer runpy.run_module and fall back to sensible
import attempts.

This file is intentionally small and defensive so users can run the repository
entrypoint (``python main.py``) or the installed entrypoint that points here.
